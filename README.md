## Introduction

This project allows you to build infrastructure needed for building, testing and
deploying NHS Digital Website.

Currently we are supporting two platforms

* **BloomReach onDemand**
* **AWS**




## Usage

Run `make help` to get a list of available commands.

In most cases you will run something like this:

```
# authenticate your terminal for 1h to access `nhsd-profile-name` AWS profile using
# your MFA token.
$(make aws-sudo PROFILE=nhsd-profile-name TOKEN=...)
```

If you have aws CLI installed on your machine you could test 
your authentication works by trying to list S3 buckets:
```
aws s3 ls
```

The actual value of `nhsd-profile-name` has to be the same as the name of the
profile you chose when configuring your local AWS client (see
[Installation](#installation) section).
If your AWS API access isn't configured for MFA you can leave the `TOKEN=`
parameter out.

```
# run commands...
make stack ROLE=aws_foundation ENV=mgt
make stack ...
```

In `make stack` command, the value passed as `ROLE` parameter is the name of one of
the folders under `ansible/roles` directory in the codebase, e.g. `aws_permissions`.
`ENV` identifies the environment you want to update the stack for.

## Requirements

In order to use this project you need:

* [python virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
* Access to NHSD AWS account.


## Installation

Everything you need will be installed locally. Simply run:

```
make init
```

Perform a one-off configuration of your local Amazon CLI client by executing:
```bash
ansible/.venv/bin/aws --profile nhsd-profile-name configure
```  
This will ask you to provide your AWS access key id and access key value, AWS region
(`eu-west-1`) and preferred [format of output generated by the client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/controlling-output.html).
It then saves those details in `~/.aws/configuration` and `~/.aws/credentials`.
The name of the profile (`nhsd-profile-name`), is an arbitrary value, specific
to your local client configuration, but, once chosen here, needs to be used with
all `aws-sudo` commands (see [Usage](#usage) section).

## Configuration

Configuration is kept in `env.mk` file. You can set/override any variable defined
in `Makefile`

```
# your user name for SSH
USERNAME ?= firstname.lastname
# AWS (ssh) ec2 key pair name
KEY_NAME ?= firstname.lastname
```

Activate virtualenv:
```bash
source ansible/.venv/bin/activate
```
